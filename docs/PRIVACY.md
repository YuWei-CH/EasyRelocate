## Summary
EasyRelocate helps users save housing listings from supported sites and compare them in the EasyRelocate web app. The extension stores a workspace token and sends listing data to the user’s configured EasyRelocate backend.

## Data We Collect
**From the extension:**
- **Authentication information:** A workspace token provided by the user (stored locally).
- **Website content:** Listing details from supported websites (e.g., title, price, location text, URL) and any text the user explicitly selects and saves.

**We do NOT collect:**
- Personal communications
- Health data
- Financial/payment data
- Device location/GPS
- Web browsing history
- Keystrokes or behavioral analytics

## How We Use Data
- To save listings to the user’s workspace.
- To display saved listings in the EasyRelocate web app.

## Data Storage
- The workspace token and API base URL are stored locally in the user’s browser storage.
- Listing data is sent to the user’s EasyRelocate backend configured by the user.

## Data Sharing
We do not sell or share data with third parties. Data only goes to the user’s own backend API endpoint.

## User Control
Users can:
- Remove the token or change the API base URL in Extension Options.
- Clear browser storage or uninstall the extension to remove local data.
